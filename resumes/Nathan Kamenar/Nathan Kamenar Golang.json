    "summary": "Strategic Senior Full Stack Engineer with 9+ years of experience designing, building, and operating end-to-end web applications, owning both backend services and frontend user interfaces in production environments. Strong backend focus on Golang, delivering high-performance microservices, REST and gRPC APIs, and event-driven systems, while working in polyglot stacks that include Java, Node.js (basic), and Python for AI-enabled services. Hands-on experience developing modern frontend applications using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, as well as Go templating frameworks (Gin templates, Fiber) for server-side rendering. Proven expertise in unit, integration, and contract testing in Go, cloud-native deployments on AWS, CI/CD automation, and distributed system design, with a strong track record of mentoring engineers and delivering scalable, maintainable full stack solutions.",
